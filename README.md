# My CPUs
This repo serves as a collection of all my designed logic circuits for CPUs, that I've produced in my spare time - you may use them as a learning tool (be advised, a lot of the documentation is flaky and unexplained!) or as a basis to improve upon for your own projects. Or whatever, really, it's GPL-3 licensed!
### What are these files?
The *.dig* files are schematics for the digital logic simulator, [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital). I used this tool to both create and verify my logic circuits, as a simple starting point, and because I'm very lazy when it comes to VDHL. The text documents are simple spec sheets - they completely remove any hardware constraints that a real chip's spec sheet may list, instead showing just the instruction sets used and any other related info.
